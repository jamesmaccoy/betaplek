# DatePicker Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The shadcn Calendar component has been successfully integrated into your Payload CMS form builder system.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Added DatePicker to Form Fields**
   - Location: `src/blocks/Form/fields.tsx`
   - The DatePicker component is now exported and available for forms

### 2. **Configured Form Builder Plugin**
   - Location: `src/plugins/index.ts`
   - Added `datePicker: DatePickerBlock` to the form builder plugin configuration
   - This registers the DatePicker as an available field type in the admin interface

### 3. **Updated Payload Types**
   - Location: `src/payload-types.ts`
   - Added `datePicker` block type to the Form interface with properties:
     - `name`: Field name
     - `label`: Display label
     - `width`: Field width percentage  
     - `maxDays`: Maximum number of days for date range
     - `required`: Whether the field is required

## How to Use in Admin

### Step 1: Start Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Access Payload Admin
Navigate to: `https://www.simpleplek.co.za/admin`

### Step 3: Create or Edit a Form
1. Go to **Forms** in the admin sidebar
2. Click **Create New** or edit an existing form (like your "Checkin" form)
3. In the **Fields** section, click **Add Field**
4. You should now see **Date Picker** as an option in the field types dropdown

### Step 4: Configure the DatePicker Field
When you add a Date Picker field, you can configure:
- **Name**: The field name (e.g., `event-date`)
- **Label**: The display label (e.g., `Event Date`)
- **Width**: Field width as a percentage (1-100)
- **Maximum Days**: Maximum number of days allowed in the date range
- **Required**: Check if the field must be filled

## Example Configuration

For your "Checkin" form, you might want to add:

```
Field Type: Date Picker
Name: checkin-dates
Label: Check-in Date Range
Width: 100
Maximum Days: 7
Required: Yes
```

## Features

- **Date Range Selection**: Users can select a start and end date
- **Visual Calendar Interface**: Two-month calendar view with navigation
- **Validation**: 
  - Required field validation
  - Maximum days limit validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly popover interface
- **Form Integration**: Works seamlessly with react-hook-form

## Testing the DatePicker

1. Add the DatePicker field to your "Checkin" form
2. Save the form
3. Create a page that uses this form
4. View the page on the frontend
5. The DatePicker should appear with a calendar icon button
6. Clicking it opens a beautiful calendar interface for date selection

## Troubleshooting

### If DatePicker doesn't appear in field types:
1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Clear browser cache and reload the admin panel
3. Check browser console for errors

### If there are TypeScript errors:

```

2. Verify Tailwind CSS is configured correctly
3. Check browser console for styling errors

## API Response Example
